# Eclipse

Camera automation tools, scripts and notes for getting HDR solar corona during total solar
eclipse

## Working environment

- Nikon D850 via USB-C, photos stay on cards, no immediate downloads, CH mode set, AEB
  bracketing to 9 frames, 0.3 step
- Gphoto2 installed via homebrew
- MacOS (note: needs sudo)

## Todos

- [x] make the camera and gphoto2 co-operate in bracketed burst mode at 9 FPS
- [ ] make the eclipse schedule be supported (triggering shots before and after totality)
- [ ] multiple cameras support, and make D300s shine one more time
- [ ] test it on multiple cameras and multiple runs at the same time (simulate the eclipse
  schedule)
